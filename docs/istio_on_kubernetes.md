# Istio on Kubernetes

## Sidecar Injection

- **Manual Sidecar Injection**: In manual sidecar injection, the Istio **Envoy proxy** sidecar is added to the Kubernetes pod using a command before deploying the application. This is done by modifying the pod's YAML configuration to include the sidecar container specification.
- **Automatic Sidecar Injection**: Automatic injection happens via Istioâ€™s **admission controller webhook**. When enabled, every pod within a specific namespace (or with certain annotations) automatically gets the Envoy sidecar added to it upon deployment, without manually modifying the pod specification.
- **Example**: Automatic injection can be enabled by labeling a namespace with `istio-injection=enabled` or pod with `sidecar.istio.io/inject="true"`.

## Namespaces and Multi-Tenancy

- **Role**: **Namespaces** in Kubernetes are used to isolate environments or applications within the same cluster. Istio leverages namespaces for **multi-tenancy**, allowing different teams or services to operate independently within the same mesh.
- **Multi-Tenancy Features**: 
  - **Traffic isolation**: You can enforce policies that ensure services in one namespace can't communicate with services in another unless explicitly allowed.
  - **Security and observability**: Role-based access control (RBAC), mTLS, and monitoring can be applied at the namespace level.
- **Example**: Different teams can deploy their services in separate namespaces, and you can set specific Istio policies for each namespace to control traffic, access, and security.

## Istioctl

- **Role**: **Istioctl** is Istio's **command-line tool** for managing, configuring, and troubleshooting the service mesh. It simplifies complex tasks like installing Istio, checking configurations, and inspecting resource statuses.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Install and upgrade Istio**: Install Istio control plane components with simple commands.
  - **Traffic management**: Inspect and manage VirtualServices, DestinationRules, and Gateways.
  - **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose problems in the mesh, validate configurations, and simulate routing rules.
- **Example Commands**:
  - `istioctl install`: Install Istio.
  - `istioctl proxy-status`: Check the status of sidecar proxies.
  - `istioctl analyze`: Analyze configurations and identify potential issues.
