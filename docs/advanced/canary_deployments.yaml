# CANARY DEPLOYMENT

# A technique for gradually rolling out a new version of a service to a subset of users while leaving the rest of the users on current stable version. 
# This allows teams to monitor the behavior of the new version on a small percentage of usrs before fully deploying it to the entire user base.

# - Controlled Rollout: Gradually send a percentage of traffic to the new version while keeping most users on the stable version.
# - Safety Mechanism: Allows monitoring of new releases for issues (such as performance degradation or errors) before scaling up.
# - Traffic Shifting: Istio’s VirtualService and DestinationRule resources can be used to control traffic distribution between different service versions.

# Progressive delivery is a modern deployment strategy that builds on the principles of canary deployments 
# by gradually increasing traffic to the new version based on real-time metrics and health checks.
# It ensures that updates are rolled out slowly and only promoted if key performance indicators (KPIs) remain positive.

#   - Automated Traffic Shifting: Based on performance and success metrics (e.g., latency, error rates), traffic is gradually shifted from the old version to the new version.
#   - Roll Back on Failure: If the new version shows signs of failure, Istio can automatically reduce or stop the traffic to the new version.
#   - Metrics-Based Decision Making: Integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus allows traffic to increase only if predefined metrics (like error rate, response time) remain healthy.
