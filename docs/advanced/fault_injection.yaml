# FAULT INJECTION
# is a feature in Istio that allows to simulate failures within the service mesh to test the resilience of services.
# By deliberately introducing faults like delays or errors, you can observe how your system behaves under adverse conditions and ensure that your applications can tolerate failures gracefully.

# - Delays: Introduce artificial delays to simulate network latency.
# - Abort/Errors: Simulate HTTP or gRPC errors to test how services handle failed requests.
