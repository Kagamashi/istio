**# JWT and Token-Based Authentication in Istio**

## **Handling Identity Across Multiple Services**
In a microservices environment, services may need to forward JWTs for inter-service authentication.

### **JWT Propagation Example**
- Service A receives a request with a JWT.
- It forwards the same JWT to Service B for authentication.
- Service B validates the JWT before processing the request.

### **Example Using Istioâ€™s PeerAuthentication and RequestAuthentication**
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: strict-mtls
  namespace: default
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: RequestAuthentication
metadata:
  name: jwt-auth
  namespace: default
spec:
  jwtRules:
    - issuer: "https://auth.example.com"
      jwksUri: "https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
```
- Ensures that service-to-service communication is secure (mTLS enforced).
- Each service verifies JWTs to authenticate users and service requests.

## **Conclusion**
- Istio enables JWT validation using `RequestAuthentication`.
- External IdPs handle authentication, while Istio enforces validation and access control.
- JWT claims can be used in `AuthorizationPolicy` to implement fine-grained access control.
- Propagating JWTs ensures authentication is maintained across multiple services.
