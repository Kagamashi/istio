# AUTHORIZATION POLICY
# is a key security feature in Istio that allows you to control access to your services based on who is making the request and what actions they are trying to perform. 
# It implements fine-grained, role-based access control (RBAC) for service-to-service  and end-user-to-service communication.
# With AuthorizationPolicies, you can allow or deny traffic based on 
# - service identities, 
# - namespaces, 
# - IP addresses, 
# - request properties...

# Key Features:
#   Service-to-Service Access Control: Define policies for internal communication between services within the mesh.
#   End-User Access Control: Control which end-users can access specific services using JWT tokens or other identity mechanisms.
#   Flexible Conditions: Authorization decisions can be based on request properties such as paths, methods, headers, and more.
#   Deny and Allow Rules: Supports both allow and deny actions, providing flexibility in defining access control rules.

_____________________________________________

# selector: Specifies which workloads (services) the policy applies to by matching labels on the pods (e.g., app: my-service). If omitted, the policy applies to all workloads in the namespace.
# action: Defines whether the policy allows or denies access. The action can be either:
#   ALLOW: Allows the request if it matches the specified rules.
#   DENY: Denies the request if it matches the specified rules.
# rules:
#   from: Specifies the source of the request, which can be defined based on:
#     principals: List of authenticated identities (e.g., service accounts or JWT claims) that are allowed or denied.
#     namespaces: Namespaces allowed to send requests.
#     ipBlocks: Specifies a list of source IP blocks in CIDR notation.
#     requestPrincipals: JWT principals (usually representing users) for end-user authentication.
#   to: Defines the destination for the request and its operations:
#     methods: List of HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, etc.) allowed by the policy.
#     paths: Specifies the allowed paths for the request (e.g., /admin/*).
#     ports: Restrict the request to specific ports on the destination service.
#   when: (Optional) Specifies additional conditions, such as JWT claims, request headers, or other request properties. For example, allowing access only to users with a certain role in the JWT.
# action: DENY: You can also define deny rules to block specific sources or requests from accessing a service. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules.

_____________________________________________

# Example Use Cases:
#   Restrict Access by JWT Role: You can enforce that only users with an admin role in their JWT claims can access certain paths of a service, such as /admin/*.
#   Service-to-Service Authorization: Restrict internal service communication to only specific service accounts or namespaces within the mesh, ensuring that only authorized services can access others.
#   Block Specific IP Ranges: Use the DENY action to block certain IP ranges from accessing services, adding an extra layer of security.

# ALLOW TRAFFIC ONLY FROM SPECIFIC SERVICE ACCOUNT
# This policy allows traffic only from a specific Kubernetes service account (my-service-account) to the service running with the app: my-service label.
